# GANS_Thesis_TU-KL
I am a student of Masters in Intelligent System in TU Kaiserslautern. This repo will contain all the research work related to my thesis in GANs. Before this thesis, I have worked on a project to create a synthetic dataset. This dataset is being used for the Yolo net's training. We had used Unreal Engin for simulation and Blender for 3D models of Sugarbeet plants. These models of sugar beet plants are placed in a simulated Farmland environment. A Camera is attached to a tractor that takes images of sugar beet planted in the soil.  Once the images are collected, I  then use the OpenCV python library for the creation of the dataset.
