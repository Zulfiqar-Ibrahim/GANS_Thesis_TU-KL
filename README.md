# GANS_Thesis_TU-KL
I am student of Masters in Intelligent System in TU Kaiserslautern. This repo will contain all the research work related to my thesis in GANs. Before this thesis, I have worked on project in which I was tesked to create synthtict dataset and use it in training of the Yolo net, for classification and detection. We had used Unreal Engin for simulation and Blender for 3D models of Sugarbeet plants.
